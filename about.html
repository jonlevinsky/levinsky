          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Jan Levínský, but everyone calls me Honza. I am a young and enthusiastic 16-year-old student living in Prague, the heart of the Czech Republic. I am studying Film and Television Creation at the prestigious SPSŠT Panská school in Prague. Photography has been a passion of mine since childhood, and now I have the opportunity to fully develop my enthusiasm and talent thanks to my school, where we have the opportunity to participate in photographic practices. My dream is to become a successful and talented photographer.</p>
            <p>Photography is more than just a hobby for me, it's a way to express myself and capture the world around me. Every time I look through the lens, I see something new, something that I've never seen before. It's this sense of discovery and creativity that keeps me going and inspires me to continue exploring new styles and techniques. I love capturing the beauty of nature, the emotions of people, and the details of the world that often go unnoticed.</p>
            <p>I am eager to continue learning and growing as a photographer. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to develop my skills. Whether it's capturing portraits, landscapes, or still-life images, I strive to create meaningful and beautiful works of art that tell a story. I believe that photography is not just about capturing what's in front of the lens, but about capturing the essence of life and the moments that matter most.</p>
            <p>I hope that you will enjoy exploring my portfolio and that my passion for photography will inspire you in your own creative journey. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I am always open to new experiences and opportunities.<p>
          <h2>What gear am I using?</h2>
            <p>I capture my images with a powerful Canon 250D camera and two versatile lenses that help me achieve perfect results - the Canon zoom lens EF 70mm-300mm 1:4-5.6 IS USM and the Canon zoom lens EF-S 18mm-55mm 1:4-5.6 IS STM. However, my favorite lens is the telephoto lens with a focal length of 70mm-300mm, which allows me to achieve great results in any situation. With these tools, I can produce incredibly vivid and detailed images that are full of emotion and beauty.</p>
            <p>The Canon 250D camera and these lenses are an extension of my creative vision. They allow me to capture the essence of life and the moments that matter most. I love to explore new techniques and styles, and these tools give me the freedom to experiment and push the boundaries of my photography. Whether I'm capturing portraits, landscapes, or still-life images, I know that I have the equipment I need to achieve the results I want.</p>              
            <p>In conclusion, my Canon 250D camera and lenses are an essential part of my photography kit. They help me capture the beauty of the world around me and allow me to bring my creative vision to life. Whether I'm exploring new techniques, experimenting with new styles, or just enjoying the art of photography, I know that I have the tools I need to succeed.</p>
